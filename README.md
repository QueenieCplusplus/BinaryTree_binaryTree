      leaf nodes numbers

      degree2 nodes numbers

to observe this data type, we shall determine the max number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k and the relationship between the number of leaf nodes and the number of degree2 nodes in a binary tree.


below graph is a full binary tree of depth 4 with sequential node numbers:

                                    1
                                    
                         2                      3
                         
                  4            5           6           7
